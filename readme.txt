== Installation and Usage: ==
The installation is fairly simple and straightforward. If you have ever installed any WordPress plugin, then there is nothing new for you. First, you need to have WooCommerce installed and activated on your site. If you do not have WooCommerce installed and activated on your system, then the plugin will generate an error message as it requires WooCommerce to function properly.
